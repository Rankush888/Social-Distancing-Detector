# Social distance detector

This is social detection program based on the yolov3 object detection. You need to download yolov3 weights using

     yolov3 weights file   - https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
     yolov3 configure file - https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg


#### or
You can prefer https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ in order to load the yolo model necessary files.
 


## Features

it has mainly three features 

        - Person detection.
        - Violation raise alert.
        - Maintaining the database.

## Documentation
 - ### What is Social distancing.

    #### In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other.

 - ### What is Object detection.
    #### Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos. 

 - ### What is YOLOV3.
    #### YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies specific objects in videos, live feeds, or images. YOLO uses features learned by a deep convolutional neural network to detect an object. Versions 1-3 of YOLO were created by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi.
